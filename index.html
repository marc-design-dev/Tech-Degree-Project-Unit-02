        <p>I'm a Front-End Developer that loves Resposive Designs. 
            I want to design beautiful User Interfaces and be able to implement them using Code.
            I also enjoy to travel all around the world and work with various clients. 
            Another hobby is to visit different BJJ gyms wherever I go.</p>

            <h3>Marketing Page</h3>
            <p>This is a website I created to Market a Band. They could send out Newsletter to their fans and post pictures while on tour.</p>
        </div>

            <h3>Search Page</h3>
            <p>On this Website you can search for anything. But the relults will always be dog related. So be prepared for pugs in business suits.</p>

            <h3>Travel App</h3>
            <p>This is an App to journal your travels. You can store photos and journal entries of your favorite spots.</p>

            <h3>Map of Favorite Sport</h3>
            <p>I really enjoy playing golf, so I created a golf course map builder so that players can build their own or their home course to creat a playing strategy.</p>

            <h3>Photo Gallery</h3>
            <p>This is a Photo app to store your memories but you can't ever search for a specific photo, think of it as an ipod shuffle, showing you random images.</p>
